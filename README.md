   Using the idea of LocalAppTT, update the front-end of the app to be a hub for multiple uses. By using Flutter we can achieve scalability and adaptability so that        users won't be downloading one (1) app for a single use only. Giving more life into the app by introducing a variety of services. Using Flutter with a firebase back-    end I plan to complete the initial phase 1 of the project by June 2025.
